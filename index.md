## Reflection Questions

**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
I found the study of generalization is interesting. We can achieve higher performance by less smart models with certain amount of human supervision, which is not worse than an advanced model.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
For Q2, I’d like to explore more about LLM and AI agents, and how do we merge them into productive tools. Right now I was working on the warm up project, and I wonder what does my mentor's project really doing.

**3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
I’d do more working in advance, and try to have more communication about obstacles and questions of my project with my mentor.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I’d like to combine CV skills with my project, for example apply basic CNN and compare with more advanced models.
